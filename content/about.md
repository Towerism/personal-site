# About me

As a seasoned senior front-end engineer at Joyent (a Samsung subsidiary), I work on the client team within the Samsung Private Cloud development Group. My days are filled with designing and implementing innovative solutions for complex challenges, leveraging technologies like Vue.js, Nuxt, Pinia, Node.js, GraphQL, HTML, and SCSS.

Beyond work, Iâ€™m an avid tech tinkerer, a car-detailing enthusiast, and a devoted husband.
