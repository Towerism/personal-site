# About me

I am Senior Front End Engineer at Joyent, a subsidiary of Samsung. I am the tech lead for the Client team of the Samsung Private Cloud development group. I design and implement solutions for complex problems. I use technologies such as Vue.js, Nuxt, Pinia, HTML, SCSS.

When I'm not at work, you can find me tinkering around with tech at home, detailing my cars, and spending time with my wife.
