I'm a web developer and a tinkerer.

Currently I find myself messing around self-hosting things on my home network. Things like AdGuard DNS, Vaultwarden password manager, etc. During the day I write code for Samsung. I work with a lot of different tech, but mainly I work with Vue.js, GraphQL, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
